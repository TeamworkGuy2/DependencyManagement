DependencyManagement
==============
version: 0.1.0

Dependency management utilities for managing Java '.jar' dependencies in Eclipse projects. 
There is not yet a cohesive public API, but the goal is to provide automated maintenance of '.classpath' files via Node.js NPM 'package.json' style dependency definition files.
